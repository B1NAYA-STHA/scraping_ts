      "description": "An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Procurement Lead to shape and drive the strategic direction of procurement within a respected regional organisation based in Hamilton. This role is perfect for someone who thrives on providing high-level guidance, ensuring that procurement strategies are not only robust and future-focused but also aligned with government policy and the broader needs of the communityWhat you'll do:As Procurement Lead you will play a crucial role in shaping how the organisation approaches its purchasing activities at every level. Your day-to-day responsibilities will see you working closely with senior leaders to set strategic priorities for procurement while ensuring that all processes are efficient, transparent, and aligned with both regulatory requirements and community expectations. You will act as a trusted advisor across multiple directorates—educating colleagues on best practices in contract management; reviewing tender recommendations; providing guidance during planning stages; and supporting staff who hold accountability for contracts.Develop and lead the strategic direction for procurement services, ensuring alignment with government policy and organisational objectives while proactively identifying opportunities for broad procurement outcomes.Design, review, and implement fit-for-purpose procurement strategies, policy frameworks, and processes that deliver sustainable benefits across the business.Provide expert advice, education, and support to staff at all levels to ensure an end-to-end approach to procurement encompassing needs analysis, market development, strategic sourcing, supplier contracting, and management.Establish regular reporting mechanisms to track benefits and savings achieved through procurement activities, offering insights that inform decision-making at the highest levels.Identify strategic commercial opportunities for the organisation and support their implementation by collaborating closely with senior leadership teams.Offer oversight and thought leadership to staff responsible for procurement within their directorates, guiding them through complex tendering processes and probity requirements.Build strong relationships with key external partners including central government agencies, local authorities, contractors, service providers, and sector peers to maximise regional and national procurement opportunities.Champion sustainability by embedding environmental considerations into all investment decisions related to goods, services, and assets procured by the organisation.Ensure compliance with all legal requirements and internal policies while actively promoting excellent customer service in line with organisational values.Contribute positively to health and safety culture by adhering to relevant policies, participating in hazard management reviews, and supporting civil defence initiatives as required.What you bring:You will bring extensive experience managing high-value procurements within complex organisations—ideally those operating in public sector or similarly regulated environments. Your background should include hands-on involvement in developing strategy frameworks; leading cross-functional teams through change; negotiating contracts; managing risk; overseeing compliance; driving process improvements; reporting on performance metrics; facilitating stakeholder engagement; championing sustainability initiatives; supporting knowledge sharing among colleagues; resolving disputes amicably; adapting quickly when priorities evolve; demonstrating empathy towards others’ perspectives; communicating persuasively regardless of audience size or composition; exercising sound judgement when making recommendations under scrutiny from multiple parties simultaneously. Your interpersonal skills will be second-to-none: you thrive on building trust-based networks both inside your own team structure as well as externally among partner organisations. A passion for continuous learning coupled with genuine enthusiasm for helping others succeed makes you an invaluable resource throughout every stage of the procurement lifecycle.A tertiary qualification in business administration, economics, logistics or supply chain management is essential for success in this position as it provides a solid foundation for understanding complex procurement environments.Membership of the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (MCIPS) or equivalent professional accreditation is highly desirable as it demonstrates your commitment to best practice standards within the field.At least 9-10 years’ experience in senior procurement roles within large or complex organisations is required so you can confidently navigate multifaceted challenges with a strategic mindset.Exceptional written and verbal communication skills are necessary to convey complex information clearly across diverse audiences including executive leadership teams and external partners.Proven ability to build effective relationships with stakeholders at all levels—both internally across departments and externally with suppliers or government agencies—is vital for achieving shared objectives.Demonstrated critical thinking skills enable you to analyse situations holistically while aligning procurement decisions with long-term organisational goals.Political awareness combined with sensitivity when dealing with confidential or bi-cultural issues ensures you can operate effectively within dynamic public sector environments.Experience delivering results under pressure in rapidly changing political contexts is important so you can maintain focus on key deliverables even when circumstances shift unexpectedly.Previous exposure to local government or public sector settings is advantageous as it equips you with valuable insights into statutory requirements and governance structures relevant to this role.What sets this company apart:This organisation stands out due to its unwavering commitment to serving its communities through responsible stewardship of resources while fostering an inclusive workplace culture built on respect, transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Employees benefit from flexible working arrangements designed to support work-life balance alongside generous professional development opportunities tailored towards individual growth aspirations.What's next:If you are ready to take your career in strategic procurement to new heights within an organisation dedicated to positive community impact—this is your moment!Apply today by clicking on the link provided—your next rewarding challenge awaits.Robert Walters endeavours to review all applications in a maximum of five working days.
