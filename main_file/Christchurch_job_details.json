Keen to do real work that actually matters?If the idea of spending your days on farms, in the sun, in the hills, or right next to the coast sounds better than sitting in an office… keep reading.This role is for someone who gets a kick out of seeing the instant impact of their work. You turn up to a dirty trough, clean it out, blast it, and 10 minutes later it’s spotless. Job done. Farmer happy. Stock healthier. On to the next one.It’s physical, it’s gritty, and it’s also pretty epic.Why This Work MattersFarmers rely on clean water for their animals. When troughs are neglected, young stock suffer and farm operations slow down. You’re not just doing a task. You’re making a meaningful difference to people who feed the country.Plus, you’ll become a familiar face on some of the best farms in Canterbury and beyond. Think southern hills, snow on the ridgelines, coastal blocks with ocean views, big farms with stunning scenery, that’s your Monday.What You’ll Be DoingCleaning and waterblasting farm troughs on siteUsing pumps, hoses, gear and a high pressure systemShovelling out leftover debris and giving each trough a proper resetWorking in Dairy sheds in winter (ceilings, floors, pits, pressure cleaning)Driving between farms (expect plenty of road time, 10-15hours per week )Keeping gear tidy, safe and looked afterOccasionally staying away overnight (usually 1 to 2 nights per month, plus the odd 7 to 8 day run for Southland jobs)Who This Role Is Perfect ForYou’ll thrive here if you:Enjoy being outside all dayLove driving deep into rural Canterbury and beyondNotice details and stay aware of farm hazardsAppreciate farmers, their humour, and the lifestyleCan handle long days and physical workAre under 35, fit, healthy and keen for adventureDon’t mind shovelling when the job needs itTake pride in doing a job properly, not rushing or wrecking gearWho This Role Is NOT ForThis won’t suit you if you:Hate drivingPanic about mud, soft ground, or off-road accessAre rough with equipment, vehicles or toolsDon’t like being on your own for long stretchesWant a cruisy, low effort jobAvoid physical workAren’t comfortable in rural environmentsThe Honest BitsSome days are unreal. Snow on the ground, mountains in the background, great farmers, big farms, epic views.Some days absolutely suck.Rain. Mud. Frozen fingers. Shovelling stones out of troughs that won’t pump properly.It’s hard work. That’s why the pay is good.Pay and Practical StuffYou’ll work around 50 hours a weekTypical day is 10 hours including travel, farm access and setupYou’re on the road a lot, but you’ll also spend time on foot doing hands-on workYou’ll use a dedicated work truck (left at the yard each day)Full training providedManual licence requiredNo farm experience needed, but a farming background helps a lotHow to ApplyIf you’re reading this thinking “that’s me”, then we want to hear from you.Send us:Your CV (or a simple summary of your work history)A short note telling us why this role stood out to youHit APPLY or email us directly",
